      Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a
      single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each
      (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a
      hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the
      opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such
      a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player
      unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the
      opposite player will.
